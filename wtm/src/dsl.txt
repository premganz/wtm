v4 16/11/16


Much of the classification of the previous part to be retained, but the classification of the template and content as independent
entities or "collections" when housed in a json db is to be kept from legacy

What is needed is the structure of templates would be like
C01T, C02T which are simply the Layout Type with a running number and suffixed by T

As for content it would be ; This would be a seperate collection
A01C02 - which is a subject based classification, A01 being the subject code, and C is the reference to the template to which it is 
designed to fit, and the Running number trails

As for a third collection the meta of the content would be like A01C02_meta which would be a redefines of the CXT template it would 
contain meta_information apart from the overriding of redefines. 

The override codes for the meta is M for merge, S for supersede and blank/null for Inherit



======================================

Version 3 11/11/16

Content should be prime, templates are just types of containers to hold them , the semantics are purely structural
So template would just have single character which might be
L - Main Menu
M - Landing Page
N - Sub landing page

C - Basic 2 Col Content
D - Simple Content
E - Wrapper Page
F - Multimedia Page
G - Blog Page

Content would have convention based on topics and subtopics based on domain, the semantics are functional

Content Sancity code
===============
A - Keystone or Permenant
B - Fragment Contextual( needs precedent to interpret)
C - Regular Default
D - Under editing
E - Trending needs promotion 
F - Minor Note


Examples
=======

D02F01 -  Minor Note on computing practicals probably would not have its own template holder, but be picked up by some other
CD02C11 - Template that holds a blog in practical computing including the meta data like date edited of the content and its related notes such as
			the above mentioned example. It can have news links and links to other templates for query on "more on this".
			It can contain list of topics that respond to 

CX- Top level for all content screens
			
CD99 - It is the core format for the template, which can be overridden in case of wanting to give explicit links etc.
		This minimizes work where we need a base page with links to promotional material and which can respond to next and next 
		clicks simply showing D02C11 or D02C12 or D02C35


CD02 - Next level to CD99 we would use a REDEFINES like mechanism to merge the json files. 

CD02C11 - final level json obtained from the merge and ready for conversion to object and rendering.







=====================================================================================================================

Conventions

Module-type 	Initial Letter		L for Landing, C for content display
Module Number	Running  01-99
Screen Number/Backend Command Number	01-99

Commands
=======
Two letters for command abbrev LA for landing BG for blog
Running number for Functions 01-99
Suffix Type		T for backend command


The commands are created to be like CX99T LX99T and BX99T to represent a template
These are just content templates, the actual content would have a format as

First single letter for functional module in the application, prefixed by the subsystem we are dealing with 
WA01T, WB01T, WC01T, WC02T1 (last digit is the variant of the template, for instance in pagination).

The actual content would be like WC0201 (instead of T[0-9] the content would be simple running numbers 0-99)
